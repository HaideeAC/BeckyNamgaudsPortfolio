            <h2>BECKY NAMGAUDS</h2>
            <p>
              Rebecca Namgauds is a multidisciplinary artist and choreographer
              based in London, originally from the North of England. With over a
              decade of experience spanning choreography, performance, and
              visual art, she creates visceral, movement-driven works that
              explore themes of feminism, ecology and transformation. Drawing
              from her varied background in movement disciplines, her practice
              engages the body as a site of resistance, intimacy, and ritual,
              often in direct dialogue with nature and the elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her latest work, THE HEAT, delves into themes of domesticity, the
              mundane, survival and endurance, channeling both urgency and raw
              physicality. The piece continues her exploration of the
              intersection between the body and the environment, using movement,
              sound, and visual composition to evoke landscapes of tension and
              renewal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rebecca was a Time & Space commission artist at Sadler’s Wells for
              2023/24 and continues to develop innovative dance-theatre
              projects. She has worked as an invited choreographer for Anjali
              Dance Company, collaborated with Paraorchestra and musician Liza
              Bec and choreographed a visual work for 12 Ensemble Orchestra’s
              tour of Metamorphosis. Alongside her artistic practice, she is a
              guest lecturer at The Place, London Contemporary Dance School, and
              the Laban MA programme, mentoring the next generation of movement
              artists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her independent works have toured internationally, premiering at
              major festivals and institutions. Like Honey was featured in the
              British Council Edinburgh Showcase 2019, while Rodadoras, an
              outdoor performance featuring women performing floor work in half
              a tonne of soil, remains an iconic touring piece since its 2018
              premiere. Her solo Exhibit F debuted at Dance Umbrella 2019, and
              she has since created original works for The Place (LCDS),
              Emergence and Centre for Advanced Training. Works for galleries
              include Walsall Art Gallery where she created an original
              performance for DanielSilver’s solo exhibition and more recently
              the V&A Friday Late: Diva.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rebecca’s movement direction spans across artistic disciplines,
              from luxury brand campaigns for Hermès to collaborating on
              Georgina Starr’s film Quarantaine. She has also worked on Jade
              O’Belle’s Birthright, an exploration of Black, queer femininity
              through Yoruba iconography, and movement-directed An Intermission,
              a film project supporting young adults experiencing homelessness.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a performer, she has worked across theatre, music, and fashion.
              She was part of the original cast of Marianne Elliott’s Angels in
              America at the National Theatre and has collaborated extensively
              with choreographer Holly Blakey, performing in video works and
              fashion campaigns for Vivienne Westwood and Issey Miyake. Her
              dance credits include music videos for Dua Lipa, Harry Styles, and
              Mura Masa, alongside performances for brands like Gucci, Vogue,
              Adidas, and Lululemon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuing to push the boundaries of movement and
              interdisciplinary performance, Rebecca Namgauds remains committed
              to crafting work that resonates physically and
              politically—immersing audiences in the urgency and sensuality of
              embodied experience.
